Instructions to get the bar working:

First, you must chmod +x all files within this directory (with the exception of this README file) and then move them into /usr/local/bin/ (Again with the exception of this README file). 

Secondly, in the repo, there is a directory called "dwmautostart". You need to copy that over to your home directory inside of whatever user with the directory name ".dwm" . It has to be exactly that as the autostart patch in my dwm build looks specifically to the .dwm directory.
